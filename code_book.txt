##CODE BOOK##

The purpose of this code is to achieve the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The way I wrote the code addresses these objectives in a different order, but the end result is the same.

After reading in all the required data, feature names are added as column headings for the "x_test" and "x_train" tables, which partly addresses point 4 (headings are cleaned later).

The variables are then subsetted to only include columns with either "mean" or "std" in the heading, addressing point 2.

The activities are then named using the "y_test" and "y_train" data sets joined with the "activity_labels" data (using sqldf package), addressing point 3.

Next, the test and training data are merged into a single data frame, addressing point 1.

To complete point 4, the column headings are made slightly more descriptive using a for loop and gsub() to replace existing headings.

The aggregate() function is used to calculate the mean of each variable for each subject/activity pair. This gives a total of 180 rows (6 activities across 30 subjects).

Finally, the output of the above aggregation is written into a new .txt file called "aggregated.txt".
