This code was written for the Getting and Cleaning Data final course assignment

This code pulls together data from various different files related to a study on human activity recognition using smartphones.
The raw data is labelled with feature names, the correct activity labels and subject identifiers for each experiment.

After getting and cleaning the data, the code also outputs a new .txt file containing only the averages for each "std" and "mean" variable.
